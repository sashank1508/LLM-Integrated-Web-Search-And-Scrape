I pray for their good health. I want them as well as their party to stay well. I also want\\xa0INDIA\\xa0to stay well,” Ms. Banerjee told journalists in Digha. The [Trinamool Congress](https://www.thehindu.com/topic/all-india-trinamool-congress/) chairperson refused to speak more on the issue.\\n\\n[Mamata Banerjee should be allowed to lead INDIA bloc: RJD chief Lalu Prasad](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/mamata-banerjee-should-be-allowed-to-lead-india-bloc-rjd-chief-lalu-prasad/article68968037.ece)\\n\\n![Image 16](https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/1x1_spacer.png)\\n\\nHer remarks came after veteran [Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD)](https://www.thehindu.com/topic/rashtriya-janata-dal/) leader Lalu Prasad Yadav on Tuesday (December 10, 2024) said that the leadership of INDIA bloc may be given to Mamata Banerjee. Leaders such as [NCP(SP)](https://www.thehindu.com/topic/nationalist-congress-party/) chief Sharad Pawar have also backed her.\\n\\n#### Mamata’s interview\\n\\nLast week, in an interview with Bengali television news channel News 18 Bangla, the Chief Minister had expressed her dissatisfaction with the functioning of the\\xa0INDIA\\xa0bloc, and indicated her intent to lead the\\xa0alliance\\xa0if given an opportunity.\\n\\n“I formed the\\xa0INDIA\\xa0bloc, now it is up to those leading the front to manage it. If they can’t run the show, what can I do? I would just say that everyone needs to be taken along,” Ms. Banerjee told interview.\\n\\n[Sena (UBT) open to discuss non-Congress leadership for INDIA bloc, says Sanjay Raut](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-bloc-leadership-is-open-question-indicates-shiv-sena-ubt/article68968379.ece)\\n\\n![Image 17](https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/1x1_spacer.png)\\n\\nSeveral leaders of the Trinamool Congress in the past and recently party leader Kalyan Banerjee had said that the leadership of INDIA bloc should be handed over to the Trinamool Congress chairperson because the Congress party had failed in resisting the [Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)](https://www.thehindu.com/topic/bharatiya-janata-party/).\\n\\nHowever, West Bengal State Congress president Subhankar Sarkar said that whenever the BJP faces a problem, the Trinamool gives oxygen to it as well as the Central government. Despite being part of the INDIA alliance, the Trinamool Congress and the Congress fought the Lok Sabha elections separately in West Bengal. The Trinamool won 29 seats and the Congress one whereas the BJP got 12 seats.\\n\\nPublished \\\\- December 11, 2024 09:59 pm IST\\n\\nRead Comments\\n\\n*   Copy link\\n*   [Email](mailto:?subject=Mamata%20thanks%20everyone%20who%20supported%20her%20to%20lead%20INDIA%20bloc&amp;body=Check%20out%20this%20link%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thehindu.com%2Fnews%2Fnational%2Fmamata-thanks-everyone-who-supported-her-to-lead-india-bloc%2Farticle68974205.ece)\\n*   Facebook\\n*   Twitter\\n*   Telegram\\n*   LinkedIn\\n*   WhatsApp\\n*   Reddit\\n\\nREAD LATER\\n\\nRemove [SEE ALL](https://www.thehindu.com/myaccount/?tab=bookmarks)\\n\\nPRINT\\n\\n### Related Topics\\n\\n[India](https://www.thehindu.com/tag/81/) / [West Bengal](https://www.thehindu.com/tag/235-81/) / [Kolkata](https://www.thehindu.com/tag/240-235-81/) / [Indian National Congress](https://www.thehindu.com/topic/indian-national-congress/) / [All India Trinamool Congress](https://www.thehindu.com/topic/all-india-trinamool-congress/)\\n\\n### Top News Today\\n\\n![Image 18](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/mamata-thanks-everyone-who-supported-her-to-lead-india-bloc/article68974205.ece)\\n\\n![Image 19](https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/close-image-icon.svg)\\n\\n0 / 0\\n\\nRead in App\\n\\n \\n\\n[![Image 20: Return to frontpage](https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/1x1_spacer.png)](https://www.thehindu.com/)\\n\\n[![Image 21: Google Play](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/mamata-thanks-everyone-who-supported-her-to-lead-india-bloc/article68974205.ece)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mobstac.thehindu \"Google Play\")[![Image 22: Apple Store](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/mamata-thanks-everyone-who-supported-her-to-lead-india-bloc/article68974205.ece)](https://apps.apple.com/in/app/the-hindu-news/id771672321 \"Apple Store\")\\n\\n##### The Hindu\\n\\n[About Us](https://www.thehindu.com/aboutus/) [Code of Editorial Values](https://www.thehindu.com/values/) [News Archive](https://www.thehindu.com/archive/) [Sitemap](https://www.thehindu.com/sitemap/) [Print Subscription](http://www.thehindugroup.in/subscribe/) [Digital Subscription](https://www.thehindu.com/subscription/?utm_source=footer&utm_medium=section&utm_caign=website) [Subscribe to Newsletters](https://www.thehindu.com/newsletter-subscription/) [Rss Feeds](https://www.thehindu.com/rssfeeds/) [Readers Editor-Terms of Reference](https://www.thehindu.com/readers-editor-terms/) [Authors & Contributors](https://www.thehindu.com/profile/) [Gift Front page](https://www.thehindu.com/frontpage/)\\n\\n##### Contact us\\n\\n[Contact Us](https://www.thehindu.com/contacts/) [Social Media](https://www.thehindu.com/social/) [Advertise With Us](https://www.thehindu.com/advertise-with-us/)\\n\\n##### Group News Sites\\n\\n[Business Line](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/) [BL on Campus](https://bloncampus.thehindubusinessline.com/) [Sportstar](https://sportstar.thehindu.com/) [Frontline](https://frontline.thehindu.com/) [இந்து தமிழ் திசை](https://www.hindutamil.in/) [The Hindu Centre](https://www.thehinducentre.com/) [Young World Club](https://ywc.thehindu.com/) [The Hindu ePaper](https://epaper.thehindu.com/?utm_source=Hindu&utm_medium=Menu&utm_campaign=Header) [Business Line ePaper](https://epaper.thehindubusinessline.com/login) [Crossword + Free Games](https://crossword.thehindu.com/?utm_source=thehindu&utm_medium=mainmenu)\\n\\n##### Other Products\\n\\n[RoofandFloor](https://roofandfloor.thehindu.com/?utm_source=thehindu&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=Internal-Marketing) [STEP](https://step.thehindu.com/) [Images](https://thehinduimages.com/) [Classifieds -
